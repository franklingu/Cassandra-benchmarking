Cassandra benchmarking
==============================================

### Intro
This is a benchmarking of different modeling of the same data set and same query set. By comparing performance of different modeling, we will draw conclusions about how to use Cassandra effetively and gain a better understanding in distributed databases.

### Setup
Get Cassandra installed first by following the instructions [on datastax](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/install/install_cassandraTOC.html) and then run Schema setup in CQL to set up tables.
